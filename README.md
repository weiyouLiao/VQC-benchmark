## Introduction

Welcome to VQC, a highly efficient and light-weight simulator for variational quantum circuits. VQC is crafted to simulate the *Zuchongzhi* quantum processors classically, playing a critical role in characterizing circuit noises, contributing to the Schr√∂dinger-Feynman algorithm for validation and benchmarking, and optimizing variational quantum algorithms.

The core philosophy behind VQC is threefold:

1. **Transparency:** The simulator's core algorithms are transparently implemented in the high-performance scripting language Julia, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
2. **Efficiency:** We prioritize efficiency, with a cache-optimized implementation of elementary operations and support for shared-memory parallelization to speed up computations.
3. **Automatic Differentiation:** VQC natively supports automatic differentiation, a crucial feature for both noiseless and noisy quantum circuit simulations.

This repository presents the benchmarking code and results that showcase VQC's capabilities in comparison to other simulators.

## Paper

Our work has been detailed in a paper titled "VQC: an Efficient Variational Quantum Circuit Simulator for Near-Term Quantum Algorithms". We encourage you to read the paper for a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms and methodologies employed by VQC. [Link to paper](#)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the benchmarks, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Julia 1.6 or later
- Pip

### Installation

First, clone the VQC benchmark repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weiyouLiao/VQC-benchmark.git
cd vqc-simulator
```

### Environment Setup

To replicate the benchmark environment, we recommend using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv benchmark-env
source benchmark-env\bin\activate  # On Windows use `\benchmark-env\Scripts\activate`
```

After activating the environment, install the Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the Julia dependencies, start the Julia REPL by typing `julia` in your terminal and set up the project environment:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```

## Running the Benchmarks

The benchmarks are divided into four main parts:

1. **Single Gate Operation Benchmarks** - Tests the performance of individual quantum gate operations.
2. **Quantum Circuit and Variational Quantum Circuit Benchmarks** - Evaluates the performance of quantum and variational quantum circuits.
3. **VQC Parallelization Test** - Assesses the parallelization capabilities of VQC.
4. **VQC Noisy Automatic Differentiation Test** - Tests the automatic differentiation in VQC under noisy conditions.

### How to Run

You can run the benchmark code in specific folder individually or execute all benchmarks at once.

Use the following command in the root directory:

```bash
./execute_all.sh
```

Ensure that the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x execute_all.sh
```
